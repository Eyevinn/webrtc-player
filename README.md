# webrtc-player

WebRTC player for recvonly WebRTC streams.

## Installation

```
npm install @eyevinn/webrtc-player
```

## Usage

```javascript
  import { WebRTCPlayer } from "@eyevinn/webrtc-player";

  const video = document.querySelector("video");
  const player = new WebRTCPlayer({ video: video, type: "se.eyevinn.webrtc" });
  await player.load(new URL(channelUrl));
  player.unmute();
```

## Options

```
{
  video: HTMLVideoElement;
  type: string; // type of adapter (see below for a list of included adapters below)
  adapter: BaseAdapter; // provide a custom adapter, type is "custom"
}
```

## Adapters

As SDP exchange is WebRTC media server specific this player includes adapters for various types of WebRTC media servers. 

### `se.eyevinn.webrtc`

Compatible with WebRTC media servers in [Eyevinn WHIP](https://github.com/Eyevinn/whip) project. Implements the following SDP exchange protocol:

1. WebRTC player (client) creates an SDP offer.
2. Client awaits ICE candidate selection to be completed.
3. Sends an updated local SDP in a JSON `{ sdp: <localSdp> }` to the server using HTTP POST to the specified `channelUrl`.
4. Server responds with a JSON `{ sdp: <remoteSdp> } ` containing the remote SDP.

## Custom Adapter

To provide a custom adapter extend the base class `BaseAdapter` and override the `exchangeSdp()` method.

```javascript
import { WebRTCPlayer, BaseAdapter, AdapterFactoryFunction } from "@eyevinn/webrtc-player";

class CustomAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
  constructor(peer: RTCPeerConnection, channelUrl: URL) {
    super(peer, channelUrl);
  }

  // Overload SDP exchange method
  async exchangeSdp() {
    // do stuff here
  }
}

const video = document.querySelector("video");
const player = new WebRTCPlayer({
  video: video, 
  type: "custom", 
  adapterFactory: (peer: RTCPeerConnection, channelUrl: URL) => {
    return new CustomAdapter(peer, channelUrl);
  }
});

```
